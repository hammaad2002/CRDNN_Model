TIMIT corpus:
The original TIMIT database contains 6300 utterances, but we find the 'SA' audio files occurs
many times, it will lead bad bias for our speech recognition system. Therefore, we removed the 
all 'SA' files from the original dataset and attain the new TIMIT dataset, which contains only 
5040 utterances including 3696 standard training set and 1344 test set.
